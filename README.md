# DDoS-Detection-System
This project represents my Major Project as part of the Master of Computer Applications (MCA) program at Jagan Institute of Management Studies, affiliated with Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University (GGSIPU). The project was collaboratively developed by a team of three students, including myself.

## Abstract 
This project focuses on detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks within Software Defined Network (SDN) environments. Using network emulation tools such as Mininet and monitoring solutions including Telegraf and InfluxDB, the project simulates network traffic to identify abnormal patterns indicative of DDoS attacks. The system aims to enhance network security by providing real-time detection and visualization capabilities, aiding in timely mitigation and network stability.

## System Installation and Usage Procedure Using Xterm Terminal
The system runs on Ubuntu VMs created with VMware VirtualBox. Each VM requires manual access via terminal (Xterm) to start components, rather than automated tools like Vagrant. This ensures consistent configuration for easier debugging and control.
